#  A Systematic Mapping Study on Robotic Testing of Mobile Devices
This repository comports a replication package for a systematic mapping study process applied in our paper "A Systematic Mapping Study on Robotic Testing of Mobile Devices", published in the SEAA 2022 conference.

## Replication package content

* __[Review Protocol](https://github.com/ghpc/SEAA-2022-SMS/blob/main/replication_package/REVIEW%20PROTOCOL.pdf)__: the systematic mapping study guide, setting the steps from the application of the search string to the final extraction of data from the selected articles.

* __[all-steps](https://github.com/ghpc/SEAA-2022-SMS/blob/main/replication_package/all-steps.xlsx)__: the spreadsheet that reports all the process defined in the protocol, summarizing the following main steps:
  * Search result 
  * Duplicates removal
  * Include/exclude based on title and abstract 
  * Include/esclude based on introduction and conclusion 
  * Backward snowballing
  * Foward snowballing from the selected papers

* __[data-extraction](https://github.com/ghpc/SEAA-2022-SMS/blob/main/replication_package/data-extraction.xlsx)__: the spreadsheet applied to extract data from the selected studies with the main purpose of providing informations related to the research questions, answering the following topics:
  * DOI
  * Title
  * Publication year
  * Author(s)
  * Organization and country
  * What are the reasons for using robots?
  * What types of tests are automated with robots?
  * What device/software is tested with robots?
  * Robots' details (e.g. brand, model)
  * How robots are used to promote test automation?
  * What frameworks are used to promote automation?
  * Were the results compared with other testing strategies?
  * If so, were the results successful?
  * What are the identified limitations?
  * What is planned as future work?
  * List any referenced work that is also worth reading.
  * Other relevant information.

* __[unification - stepE+BackwardSnowballingE+FowardSnowballingE](https://github.com/ghpc/SEAA-2022-SMS/blob/main/replication_package/unification%20-%20stepE%2BBackwardSnowballingE%2BFowardSnowballingE.xlsx)__: the main spreadsheet that comports all the relevant informations, from researchers responsible for each paper data extraction until divided tests categories, such as test purpouse and target.
